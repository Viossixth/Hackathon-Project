This is Personal Portfolio Project for the Power Learn Academy Hackathon. The aim was to build a personal website where you showcase your skills, education, interests and knowledge of coding. The website was created with some inspiration from other software engineers. This hackathon was a great experience because i've learnt so much and understood so much about CSS,Java and HTML. Its good to learn about these languages but it's better to use them, build something and problem solve any bugs or errors along the way. Will definetely try to challenge myself to do something like this in the future.
